                Orange Tabby KING arrived to AUK, and blessed everyone with his
                presence on July 2019. He was so loved for his surreally cuddly,
                outlandish, affectionate nature, that an Instagram account named
                @pufakbeinggood, was made to honor this lovely KING back in
                February 23, 2020. Our Majesty was adopted in July 2021 by a
                kind lady in the U.S.. Hence, his current whereabouts are in
                Pennsylvania, U.S. King Pufak, Your Majesty, if you see this, we
                really miss you!

                Taco is an Orange Tabby cat that arrived to AUK some time in
                early 2019, when he was a small kitten. He is a shy and quiet
                little fella, but his trust can be gained through food and
                kneeling to his level, so he doesn't feel intimidated. Of
                course, this may take months or years, depending on the
                frequency of the feeding and affection, but don't give up. Once
                he warms up to you, he becomes cuddly and quite talkative too.

                her children, she is not an affectionate cat, as she will hiss
                and run away if a human approaches her. She is, however, a timid
                cat, and will meow for food, if she sees you have some on you.
                Just make sure you separate her from the other cats, as she is
                scared she will get injured due to her senile age.

                Intro/Tim is a Gray Tabby cat who arrived at AUK on November 4,
                2020, during the Covid period, and was discovered by @xshinzo.
                He is an introverted cat who doesn't mind being pet and likes
                being given food (of course). During his time at AUK, he has
                sustained serious wounds, as a result of being involved in
                catfights. On March 5, 2024, he was taken to a vet to receive
                treatment for his wounds; however, two days later, while he was
                on the way to the vet to receive his last dose of injections,
                the crate he was in broke, and while the driver was trying to
                catch the cat, he scratched and bit the driver, causing him to
                escape from the car. Intro was last seen in Fintas, Block 4. His
                current whereabouts are unknown.

                A pregnant Milkshake Sr. was first found in the AUK Library
                sometime in August 2022. She has been through three pregnancies,
                therefore, giving birth to three sets of children, each set
                contains four children. However, the only known set of children
                is the second set (Robert Jr/Abu Tamba Jr., Carmello, Eva,
                Milkshake Jr.), as the kittens in the first set were either
                missing, adopted, or dead, while the kittens in the third set
                have yet to show themselves. Milkshake is a cuddly and
                affectionate, but needy cat, who does not like sharing her
                territory with other cats, even with her own children, and she
                will not hesitate to teach them a lesson, even while pregnant.

                As mentioned before, this mostly white cat is one of the four
                Kitskiteers born to Abu Tamba Sr. and Milkshake Sr.. She is also
                a very naughty and playful cat. She loves food so much, he, like
                her father and mother, is willing to tresspass other cats'
                territories and scratch them for their food. However, unlike the
                rest of her siblings, she is shy at first, but once you gain her
                trust, she will warm up to you, and will let you pet her. Just
                give her food.

                This kitten that shares an uncanny resemblence to a current AUK
                cat named Eva, arrived in September 2022. She was a very cuddly
                kitten, who had another kitten as a bestfriend. Luckily,
                Caramel/Eva was adopted into a loving family some time between
                2022 and 2023.
